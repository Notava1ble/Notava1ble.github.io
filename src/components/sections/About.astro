  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a frontend developer who treats code like clay, molding ideas into
    reality. For me, coding isn’t just a job, it’s the thrill of finding a
    solution to any problem I set my mind on.
  </p>
  <p>
    My approach is experimental. I dive into functionality with a hands-on
    mindset, testing and iterating until it clicks. I value simplicity and
    readability, aiming for code that is as easy to understand as it is
    efficient.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond tech, problem-solving spills into mathematics, curiosity-driven
    exploration, and the joy of traveling. I’m always learning, trying new
    things, and seeking understanding. Whether I’m building interfaces or
    solving puzzles, it’s about turning imagination into something tangible.
